## Summary
Based on this analysis, we should move forward with opening the shop in hawaii for the following reasons:
1. **There is only a 3 degree tempurature differential from June to December**
    - This indicates the weather will be roughly the same throughout the year
2. **Both months have tempurature ranges between on average of 60 degrees to the low 80s.**
    - This appears to be vary promising weather for a surfshop since even December experiences warm weather.
